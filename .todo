GATEKEEPER

- Implement actual user principal retrieval validation/authentication
  Given credentials presented by client:

  Bearer token (authentication):
    - Validate token.
    - Resolve token to active principal in datastore.
    - Attach principal to session for later use by middleware.

  CSRF token (non-repudiation):
    - Validate CSRF token against last known CSRF of principal.
    - Generate new CSRF token.
    - Attach new CSRF token to response headers.

- Implement per-principal rate limiting.


FEDERATED SERVICES FRAMEWORK (ROUTERS)

- Implement framework for dynamic service registration.
  - Framework should not require services to be configured before startup.
    Instead, services should be able to register one or more endpoints after
    federator startup.
